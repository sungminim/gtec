                    military airfield in August 1970 with the industrial development of Korea, operating flights to and
                    from Seoul, but operation was suspended to reduce oil consumption in light of the “oil shock” in
                    March 1974. <br> Gunsan Airport as it is known today was opened in December 1992 next to the US military
                    base, launching Seoul-Gimpo routes and Jeju routes with passengers reaching 457,000 a
                    year. Unfortunately, the decrease of passengers forced the suspension of the Gimpo route in May
                    2002. Gunsan Airport has only 1 single-story building built in 1992 for up to 440,000 domestic
                    passengers, with a parking lot for 341 vehicles outside Passenger Terminal.</p>
